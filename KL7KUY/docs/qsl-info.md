# QSL Information

## QSL Policy

**I only use electronic QSL confirmations via eQSL.cc. I do not send or accept physical QSL cards.**

## Electronic QSL

### eQSL.cc (Primary Method)
- **Profile**: [KL7KUY on eQSL.cc](https://www.eqsl.cc/qslcard/Index.cfm?ReferralID=KL7KUY)
- **Status**: Active and checked regularly
- **Confirmation**: All QSOs are uploaded and confirmed via eQSL
- **Response Time**: Usually within 24-48 hours of QSO

### How to Confirm Our QSO
1. Visit [eQSL.cc](https://www.eqsl.cc/)
2. Log in to your account (or create one if you don't have one)
3. Upload your log or manually enter our QSO details
4. I'll confirm the contact via eQSL

### QSL Request Information
When requesting a QSL confirmation, please ensure your log includes:
- **Call Sign**: KL7KUY
- **Date**: UTC date of contact
- **Time**: UTC time of contact
- **Band**: Frequency band used
- **Mode**: SSB, CW, FT8, etc.
- **Signal Report**: RST sent/received

## Why eQSL Only?

I've chosen to use only electronic QSL confirmations for several reasons:
- **Environmental**: Reduces paper waste and carbon footprint from mailing
- **Speed**: Instant confirmation vs. weeks or months for paper cards
- **Cost**: No printing or postage costs
- **Convenience**: Easy to manage and search digital confirmations
- **Accessibility**: Available 24/7 from anywhere in the world

## Alternative Electronic Logging

While I primarily use eQSL.cc, you can also find my QSOs on:
- **QRZ Logbook**: [KL7KUY on QRZ](https://www.qrz.com/db/KL7KUY)

**Note**: I do not participate in ARRL's Logbook of the World (LoTW) at this time.
