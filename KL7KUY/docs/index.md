# Welcome to KL7KUY's Amateur Radio Website

## About Me

Hello! I'm KL7KUY, an amateur radio operator based in American Fork, Utah. This website serves as my personal ham radio blog, station information hub, and documentation for my various radio projects. 

System Engineer at BambooHR

Studied Information of Technology (IT) at UVU

Experienced in the intricacies of Linux system engineering within the dynamic realm of information services, I bring a robust professional background underpinned by a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Information Technology from Utah Valley University. My journey has extended beyond conventional IT domains, encompassing forays into electronics and single-board computers.

Driven by an insatiable curiosity, I am committed to daily intellectual growth, recently focusing on mastering oscilloscope diagnostics for hardware troubleshooting. Embracing the enriching camaraderie of amateur radio, a passion ignited in March 2023, I have continually elevated my proficiency. Innovations like deploying a Pockrus JPOLE antenna atop my roof have markedly enhanced my transmission capabilities.

Hailing originally from Tallahassee, Florida, my relocation to Utah in 2010 for higher education proved transformative. There, at Utah Valley University, I not only pursued but excelled in my IT studies, with a particular emphasis on cybersecurity. It was during this period that I met my beloved wife, marking the beginning of a cherished chapter that continues to inspire and motivate me professionally and personally.
